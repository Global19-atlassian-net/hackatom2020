      Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint consensus.

      In other words, Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other. Before Cosmos, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could only handle a small amount of transactions per second. Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision. In order to understand this vision we need to go back to the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

      Zabo connects any crypto wallet to your application in a few lines of code. The cryptocurrency ecosystem is fragmented, with thousands of different crypto assets, hundreds of global exchanges, and even more wallet providers. Today, as an application developer interested in crypto, you have to guess which wallet your user has, or build one yourself. Want to support MetaMask or MyCrypto? There's a web3 integration. Want to support Coinbase custodial? There's an integration. Want access mobile wallet keys? It's complicated.

      Zabo offers a single API that is capable of handling any wallet. This interface gives the dev only one integration to use, and the ability to access any.
